/*!
    \class QStylePlugin
    \brief The QStylePlugin class provides an abstract base for custom QStyle plugins.

    \ingroup plugins

    QStylePlugin is a simple plugin interface that makes it easy
    to create custom styles that can be loaded dynamically into
    applications using the QStyleFactory class.

    Writing a style plugin is achieved by subclassing this base class,
    reimplementing the pure virtual keys() and create() functions, and
    exporting the class using the Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro. See \l
    {How to Create Qt Plugins} for details.

    \sa QStyleFactory, QStyle
*/

/*!
    \fn QStringList QStylePlugin::keys() const

    Returns the list of style keys this plugin supports.

    These keys are usually the class names of the custom styles that
    are implemented in the plugin.

    \sa create()
*/

/*!
    \fn QStyle *QStylePlugin::create(const QString& key)

    Creates and returns a QStyle object for the given style \a key.
    If a plugin cannot create a style, it should return 0 instead.

    The style key is usually the class name of the required
    style. Note that the keys are case insensitive. For example:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/qstyleplugin/main.cpp 0
    \codeline
    \snippet doc/src/snippets/qstyleplugin/main.cpp 1
    \snippet doc/src/snippets/qstyleplugin/main.cpp 2

    \sa keys()
*/

/*!
    Constructs a style plugin with the given \a parent.

    Note that this constructor is invoked automatically by the
    Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro, so there is no need for calling it
    explicitly.
*/
QStylePlugin::QStylePlugin(QObject *parent)
    : QObject(parent)
{
}

/*!
    Destroys the style plugin.

    Note that Qt destroys a plugin automatically when it is no longer
    used, so there is no need for calling the destructor explicitly.
*/
QStylePlugin::~QStylePlugin()
{
