    \class QScreenDriverPlugin

    \brief The QScreenDriverPlugin class is an abstract base class for
    screen driver plugins in Qt for Embedded Linux.

    Note that this class is only available in \l{Qt for Embedded Linux}.

    \l{Qt for Embedded Linux} provides ready-made drivers for several screen
    protocols, see the \l{Qt for Embedded Linux Display Management}{display
    management} documentation for details. Custom screen drivers can be
    implemented by subclassing the QScreen class and creating a screen
    driver plugin.

    A screen driver plugin can be created by subclassing
    QScreenDriverPlugin and reimplementing the pure virtual keys() and
    create() functions. By exporting the derived class using the
    Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro, The default implementation of the
    QScreenDriverFactory class will automatically detect the plugin
    and load the driver into the server application at run-time.  See
    \l{How to Create Qt Plugins} for details.

    \sa QScreen, QScreenDriverFactory
*/

/*!
    \fn QStringList QScreenDriverPlugin::keys() const

    Implement this function to return the list of valid keys, i.e. the
    screen drivers supported by this plugin.

    \l{Qt for Embedded Linux} provides ready-made drivers for several screen
    protocols, see the \l{Qt for Embedded Linux Display Management}{display
    management} documentation for details.

    \sa create()
*/

/*!
    Constructs a screen driver plugin with the given \a parent.

    Note that this constructor is invoked automatically by the
    Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro, so there is no need for calling it
    explicitly.
*/
QScreenDriverPlugin::QScreenDriverPlugin(QObject *parent)
    : QObject(parent)
{
}

/*!
    Destroys this screen driver plugin.

    Note that Qt destroys a plugin automatically when it is no longer
    used, so there is no need for calling the destructor explicitly.
*/
QScreenDriverPlugin::~QScreenDriverPlugin()
{
}


/*!
    \fn QScreen* QScreenDriverPlugin::create(const QString &key, int displayId)

    Implement this function to create a driver matching the type
    specified by the given \a key and \a displayId parameters. Note
    that keys are case-insensitive.

    \sa keys()
