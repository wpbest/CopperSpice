    \class QDesignerScriptExtension
    \brief The QDesignerScriptExtension class allows you to generate a
    per-widget \l{QtScript} {Qt Script} snippet to be executed while
    building the form.

    \internal
    \inmodule QtDesigner
    \since 4.3

    On saving the form, the extension is queried for a script snippet
    to be associated with the widget while saving the UI file.
    This script is then run after creating the widget by \l uic or
    QUiLoader.

    As opposed to \l QDesignerCustomWidgetInterface::codeTemplate(),
    it allows for applying an internal state of the widget
    that can be manipulated using \QD.

    Such a state might for example be the contents of a custom item view widget,
    for which an editor is provided by the QDesignerTaskMenuExtension.

    While saving the form, the state is serialized as a QVariantMap of
    \QD-supported properties, which is stored in the UI file. This is
    handled by data() and setData().

    For item view contents, there might be for example a key that determines
    the number of items and other keys that contain the actual items following
    a naming scheme (\c numItems, \c item1, \c item2, ...).

    On saving, script() is invoked, which should return a script snippet that
    applies the state to the widget while building the form.
